# ML Projects - Mar '23

Practicing ML by working on various projects. Involved in tasks such as dealing with imbalanced classification, regression using TensorFlow, and anomaly detection.

- [Finance-Yahoo-LSTM:](./Finance-Yahoo-LSTM/) LSTM Autoencoder for anomaly detection in General Electric Company (GE) stocks closing prices historical data.

- [Financial-Anomaly-Data:](./Financial-Anomaly-Data/) Detecting anomalies in a financial transactions dataset using isolation forests. Also attempted to generate my own synthetic dataset for better demonstration.

- [Glass-Identification:](./Glass-Identification/) Imbalanced classification of glass categories.

- [Heart-Failure-Prediction:](./Heart-Failure-Prediction/) General ML practice.

- [Tensorflow-Regression:](./Tensorflow-Regression/) Generating synthetic data with noise, then using TensorFlow to predict that noise.
